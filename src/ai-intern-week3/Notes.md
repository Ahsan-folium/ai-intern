## Framing

1. Here we clearly identify the **input features** and **target label** before starting and Choose the right **type of ML task** , use regression for continuous predictions (e.g., prices) and classification for discrete predictions (e.g., spam/not spam) and then how to measure the success using metrics

## Gradient Descent

2. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm , it updates model parameters in the direction that **reduces the error (the loss function)**
3. We repeat untill loss is minimum

## Classification

4. Type of supervised learning where output is cattegory , types are binary and multiclass classfication
5. performance is best measured using **precision**, **recall**, depending on the use case.
